# FOF (FIND OLD FRIENDS)

Welcome to the FOF MERN project! FOF stands for "Find Old Friends," and this web application was designed to help you reconnect with your long-lost buddies from school or college. We're thrilled to present you with this personalized and creative project, brought to life by the collaborative efforts of Rahul Kumar, Ashutosh Jha, and Ashutosh Giri.

## Introduction

FOF MERN is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It serves as a platform where you can effortlessly find and connect with your old friends by providing your school, class, and academic year details.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **Client:** This directory contains all the frontend views and components. It's where the magic of the user interface happens, creating a visually appealing and interactive experience for you.
- **Server:** The backend files reside in this directory. Here, you'll find the server logic and API routes responsible for handling user requests, searching for classmates, and interacting with the database.
